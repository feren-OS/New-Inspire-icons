Colorful Icons:
- Icons should NOT be flat, as that makes them visually bland - use a variety of techniques such as gradients to give the icon depth
- A base can be added to icons beneath the 'foreground' layer, but it's entirely optional

Colorful Icons - Margins:
- 4px border margin
- Except 32px which has 2px border margin
- and 64px which has a border margin of 3 pixels

Colorful Icons - Shadows:
- Icons MUST have a hard bottom shadow of 1px
- 45 degree shadows do not fit with Inspire's design so should NOT be used
- Directionless shadows are also allowed for adding depth to parts of icons
- Do not cast shadows on stuff 'stuck' to the icon's base
- Cast a flat 1px downwards shadow on stuff physically pertruding out of the base (unless the object's semi-transparent in which case use a soft shadow instead)
- If there's a pertruding rim around the base, such as in System Settings's icon, cast a soft shadow from the inside ring of the rim inwards
- All shadows that go in directions other than down are always soft shadows

Colorful Icons - Folder Icons:
- Lines on symbols on folder icons must be 1px in thickness
- Non-line portions of symbols must be filled in
- Symbols on folders must be white
- Symbols are stuck to the folders and so DO NOT cast shadows

Colorful Icons - Mimetype/Filetype Icons:
- (to be done)


Monochromatic Icons:
- Icons follow these three pieces of the colour scheme:
  - Foreground for all of the symbols when there's no status to convey
  - Negative Text for portions of a symbol that denote destructive or otherwise bad actions or statuses, such as X symbols in Delete, or even error symbols in error icons
  - Neutral Text for portions of a symbol that denote warning statuses, such as warning symbols, as well as 'needs user interaction' statuses, such as the indicator circle of an Updates Available icon
  - Positive Text for portions of a symbol that denote success statuses, such as a Tasks Complete icon
  
- Make ABSOLUTELY sure that monochromatic icons are pixel-perfect in alignment and sizing wherever possible, otherwise icons will look blurry in execution
- Clear out space for symbols, such as action symbols, in these icons - do not overlay symbols, such as action symbols, over the icon itself
- When clearing out space for them, also clear out an extra pixel of space around the symbol
- DO NOT use monochromatic icons on sizes higher than 22px (for 'symbolic' icons just symlink the 22px icons on higher sizes) - the ONLY EXCEPTION to this rule is System Settings's symbolic icons
- When using colours in your icons, MAKE SURE the icons' meanings are still legible without colour being required
- Reuse the symbols of Folder and Mimetype icons as the symbols of their monochromatic equivalents
  
Monochromatic Icons - Margins:
- 16px icons use 2px border margins
- 22px icons use 3px border margins
- 8px icons (just emblems) DO NOT have margins around them at all


Extra Icon design guidelines:
- DO NOT theme third-party icons - the only exception to this rule is the icons of applications pre-installed in Feren OS
- Wireframe icons MUST be tweaked to follow the 'foreground' colour in applications
- Folder icons MUST be tweaked to follow the colour scheme's 'selected background' colour in general use (where Feren OS blue would otherwise be used)




Note to self: Make 96 be an icon size 48 supplies, and similarly make 64 provide 128 and 256 and 512.
