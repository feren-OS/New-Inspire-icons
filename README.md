# Inspire Icons

## Introduction

Inspire is a freedesktop.org compatible icon theme. It's developed for Feren OS and is used by default in Feren OS.

This repository is for an upcoming redesign of the icon set. The current version of the icon set can be found at https://github.com/feren-OS/Inspire-Icon-Theme.

## Guidelines

The Inspire icon set mostly adheres to the [HIG section][1] of the KDE Website, however there is plans in the future to implement a Feren OS HIG for this icon set and more..

## Issues

To report actual bugs and requests for new icons, wait until this icon set's redesign's first release which'll enable Issues for your requests to be filled in on.

## Contribute

You are free to fork this icon set and make Pull Requests to contribute to the icon set at any time, as long as you adhere to the licensing and respect the following guidelines, on top of the HIG:

- No third-party application icons should be themed

- Icons should convey what they are for / do when used (especially Actions icons)

- Icon sizes where wireframe icons are prevalent should stick to the wireframe icon style established

- Wireframe icons should be tweaked to follow the colour scheme

- Folder icons should be tweaked to follow the colour scheme
